# Student-Crime-and-Disruption-Related-Incident-Prediction-in-the-US-Public-Schools
This project was done by my team as a part of the Data Science course at Duke Fuqua School of Business - MQM Business Analytics Program - Class of 2021

1. Original data
Dataset Source: US Department of Education public dataset listings, originally published by the
National Center for Education Statistics.
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-survey-on-crime-and-safety-2016)

2. Specified Industry: Education/Public Policy (Results will help inform public school safety
finding)

3. Key Questions: Our findings would be information that would serve useful for public school
districts to know what safety and discipline measures are more effective than others, and are
worth investing funds into, in order to lower the number of student crime and offenses.
Additionally, it would allow schools to understand the relationships between other elements (like
crime where the school is located, percentage of special ed students etc. - whichever variables
we end up narrowing in on) that are driving student crime/offenses at schools so those schools
can best be prepared for offenses and/or types of offenses.

4. Secondary data set - as a result of initial cleaning from SAS survey data
- Data1.csv: was used in the cleaning part 1
- Data2.csv: was used in the cleaning part 2

5. Tools and Techniques
- Tool: R
- Techniques: EDA, Regularization (LASSO, Elastic Net) Machine Learning, Regression Modeling, Random Forest

6. List of R-codes
- Project_Team10_DataCleaningPart1: Cleaning data part 1. This cleaning step resulted in the data2.csv
- Project_Team10_DataCleaningPart2 + Modeling: This includes additional cleaning, modeling, and evaluation
